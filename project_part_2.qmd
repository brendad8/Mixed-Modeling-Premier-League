## 1. Data Cleaning Summary

To create our multi-level dataset, we had to scrape data from fbref.com (Football Reference) and transfermarkt.com. We scraped data for premier league teams starting from the 2017 season up to the most recently completed 2023 season. The data from fbref included the total points for each team, goals scored, goals conceded, expected goals, expected goals conceded, average rate of possession over the season, average age of squad, total shots, total shots on target, average distance of shots from goal and more. The data scraped for each team from transfermarkt related to each teams activity in the transfer market that season. These variables included money spent on incoming players, money gained on outgoing players, net spend, number of players in, and number of players out. To combine the two datasets, we had to clean the squad names in the datasets to reconcile the different naming conventions for teams on different sites (See cases below). Once the data was combined we performed a final step of data cleaning to create our final analysis dataset. This cleaning included transforming applicable variables to per90 (per game) values instead of season total. This allows for more easily interpretable results. Additionally, transfermarkt, had "-" to represent 0 which later turned into NA values so these values were replaced with zeros.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

### Library Package

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

library(tidyverse)
library(labelled)
```

### Load Data

```{r}
#| label: read-in-data

prem <- read_csv(here::here("data", "prem_multi_level.csv"))
```

### Add Labels

```{r}
prem <- prem %>%
  set_variable_labels(
    Squad       = "Team Name",
    Season      = "Premier League Season",
    GF          = "Goals Scored per90",
    GA          = "Goals Against per90",
    Pts         = "Point Total",
    xG          = "Expected Goals per90",
    xGA         = "Expected Goals Against per90", 
    Age         = "Average Age of Squad",
    Poss        = "Average Posession",
    Sh          = "Shots per90",
    SoT         = "Shots on Target per90",
    Dist        = "Average Dist of Shots from Goal",
    SoTA        = "Shots on Target Against per90",
    CS          = "Clean Sheets",
    Expenditure = "Money spent on incomings",
    Arrivals    = "# Players In",
    Income      = "Money gained on outgoings",
    Departures   = "# Players Out",
    Balance     = "Net Spend (Income - Expenditures)"
  )
```

### Summary Statistics

```{r}
#| label: summary-stats

# Summarize numeric variables in the dataset to get a sense of the data
summary_stats <- prem %>% 
  select(GF, GA, xG, xGA, Poss, Age, Sh, SoT, Dist, SoTA, CS, Expenditure, Arrivals, Income, Departures, Balance) %>% 
  summary()
summary_stats
```

The summary statistics show that teams have an average of around 1.42 goals scored per game (GF) and a similar average of goals conceded (GA). Expected goals (xG) are generally slightly higher than actual goals, indicating that teams may underperform compared to expected chances. The average possession (Poss) ranges from 35.4% to 71%, suggesting a diverse range of playing styles among teams. Net expenditure (Balance) also varies significantly, from highly negative values to positive, reflecting different transfer market strategies.

### Distribution of Points by Team

```{r}
#| label: dot-plot

squad_colors <- read_csv(here::here("data", "prem_team_colors.csv"))


prem %>%
  left_join(squad_colors, by = "Squad") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_dotplot(aes(x = Pts, y = Squad, fill = hex_fill, color = hex_color), dotsize = .5, stackratio = .5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  scale_color_identity() +
  theme_minimal()

```

### Correlation Analysis

```{r}
#| label: correlation-plot

# Create a correlation plot to identify relationships between numeric variables
library(corrplot)
corr_matrix <- prem %>% 
  select(GF, GA, xG, xGA, Poss, Age, Sh, SoT, Dist, SoTA, CS, Expenditure, Arrivals, Income, Departures, Balance) %>% 
  cor()
corrplot(corr_matrix, method = "color", type = "lower", tl.cex = 0.7, tl.pos = "lt", addCoef.col = "black")
```

The correlation plot reveals some strong relationships between variables. Goals Scored (GF) has a strong positive correlation with Expected Goals (xG) (0.93) and Shots on Target (SoT) (0.91), indicating that creating high-quality chances and converting them are key factors for success. Conversely, Goals Against (GA) is negatively correlated with metrics like Clean Sheets (CS) (-0.88), suggesting that teams that concede fewer goals also have more clean sheets. However, Net Spend (Balance) has a weak correlation with point total (Pts), implying that spending money does not necessarily guarantee better results.

### Possession vs Goals Scored

```{r}
#| label: goals-vs-possession

# Scatter plot for goals scored per90 vs average possession
ggplot(prem, aes(x = Poss, y = GF)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Goals Scored per90 vs Average Possession",
       x = "Average Possession (%)",
       y = "Goals Scored per90")
```

The scatter plot demonstrates a positive linear trend between possession and goals scored per game. Teams with higher possession percentages tend to score more goals, which suggests that controlling the game often leads to better attacking outcomes. However, there is still variability, indicating that other factors beyond possession influence goal-scoring effectiveness.

### Net Spend vs Points

```{r}
#| label: net-spend-vs-points

# Scatter plot for net spend vs point total
ggplot(prem, aes(x = Balance, y = Pts)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Net Spend vs Point Total",
       x = "Net Spend (in Million Euros)",
       y = "Point Total")
```

The scatter plot between net spend and point total shows a slightly negative relationship, which is somewhat counterintuitive. This suggests that high spending teams do not always achieve higher point totals, potentially due to inefficiencies in spending or challenges in integrating new players. Teams with a lower or negative net spend can still achieve success, likely due to better tactical planning, consistency, and effective resource utilization.
