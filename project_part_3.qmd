## Part I: Proposal and Data Assembly

### Background

The English Premier League (EPL) is the top tier of professional football (soccer) in England and is considered one of the most popular and competitive leagues in the world. The league is made up of twenty clubs (teams) that compete over a season for the Premier League title. Each year, three new clubs are promoted from the second division based on the previous year's results. These promoted teams replace the bottom three teams from the premier league for the previous year.

Over the course of a season, each team plays 38 matches per season, facing every other team twiceâ€”once at home and once away. Teams are rewarded points as follows: 3 points for a win, 1 points for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. The team with the most points at the end of the 38-game season is crowned as Premier League Champions.

For our project, we are interested in seeing which factors are associated of higher or lower point totals in the English Premier league. To address our main research question, we have collected data from the English Premier League for seasons between 2017 and 2023. We collected season-level data from two sites: rbref.com and transfermarkt.com. The data from fbref (football reference) includes total goals scored, total goals conceded, expected goals scored, expected goals conceded, average rate of possession (%) over the season, average age of club players, total shots, total shots on target, average distance of shots from goal, total points awarded over the season, and more. The data scraped for each club from transfermarkt related to each clubs activity in the transfer market that season. These variables included money spent on incoming players, money gained on outgoing players, net spend, number of players in, and number of players out. See example rows of data below.

```{r}
#| echo: false

prem %>%
  select(Squad, Season, GF, GA, xG, xGA, Age, Poss, Expenditure, Income, Pts) %>%
  mutate(
    Season=str_split_i(Season, "-", 1),
    across(where(is.double), .fns = ~round(.x, 2))
    ) %>%
  filter(Squad %in% c("Arsenal", "Chelsea", "Everton")) %>%
  head(3)
```

### Research Questions

What are the most important factors associated with higher/lower point totals in the English Premier League between 2017 and 2023?

Is spending more money in the off-season associated with earning more points? Does this relationship change depending on how much the league as a whole spent?

Is having a better offense or defense more important for earning more points in a season?

Does important is luck/chance with respect to premier league point totals. (We can measure luck as Expected goals scored vs Actual goals scored & Expected goals conceded vs Actual goals conceded)

### Data

We are using data scraped from fbref and transfermark for the English premier league capturing the 2017 season up to and including the 2023 season. The response is the total points a team achieved for that given season. The predictors include variables relating to a teams offensive and defensive performance and a teams off-season expenditures.

prem %>%
  left_join(squad_colors, by = "Squad") %>%

    title = "Distribution of Points by Team (2017-2023 Seasons)",
    caption = "Data from Fbref.com"
    ) +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot")
```

```{r}
model00 <- lm(Pts ~ Squad, data = prem)
anova(model00)
```

### Null Model

```{r}
model0 <- lmer(Pts ~ 1 + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
summary(model0)
```

### Add Level 1 Vars

```{r}
model1 <- lmer(Pts ~ GF + GA + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
summary(model1)
```

```{r}
model1_1 <- lmer(Pts ~ GF + GA + xG_cat + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
model1_2<- lmer(Pts ~ GF + GA + xG_diff + xGA_diff + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
model1_3<- lmer(Pts ~ GF + GA + Balance + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
model1_4<- lmer(Pts ~ GF + GA + SoT_diff + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
```

```{r}
anova(model1, model1_1)
cat("\n\n")
anova(model1, model1_2)
cat("\n\n")
anova(model1, model1_3)
cat("\n\n")
anova(model1, model1_4)
```

### Add Level 2 Vars

```{r}
prem <- prem %>%
  left_join(prem %>%
              group_by(Squad) %>%
              summarize(Balance_mean = -1*mean(Balance)),
            by = "Squad"
  )
```

```{r}
model2 <- lmer(Pts ~ GF + GA + Balance_mean + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
summary(model2)
```

### Fit Random Slopes

### Trying Longitudinal Models

```{r}
model0 <- lmer(Pts ~ 1 + Season + (1 | Squad), data = prem)
summary(model0)
```
